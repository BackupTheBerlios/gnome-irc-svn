- Don't join any channels prior to identifying with nickserv, else freenode's
  cloaking breaks (http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nocloakxchat)
- accidental flood protection
- intelligent command processing (path name recognition, /mode +o nick1 nick2
  ...)
- Don't show the password sent to NickServ in a query window, in fact don't
  show it at all
